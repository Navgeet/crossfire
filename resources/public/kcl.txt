Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur: India’s very own answer to the MITs, Stanfords and Caltechs of the world. Today, IIT Kgp (as the college is popularly called) has become the hub of the crème la crème of the Indian intelligentsia and takes pride in producing some of the finest technocrats of the world.
<br><br>
No wonder the moment you step inside the Kgp campus, you see an environment for academic excellence all around you. During day-time, stand on any road of the campus and you would see the techno 'geeks' hastily moving about on their two-wheeled luxuries, with their minds lost in the most challenging scientific problems.
<br><br>
But the moment darkness falls, a metamorphosis takes place and suddenly from nowhere these seemingly harmless 'geeks' turn into an all together different species.<br>
They are the Cyber Gamers of Kgp. Gaming is their only religion and victory their eternal bliss. Of all the cyber games; Counter-Strike, Age of Empires (AoE), Need for Speed (NFS), Quake, Unreal Tournament (UT), FIFA, Warcraft and the World of Warcraft (WoW) are the most serious addictions. And the craze for Counter-Strike 1.6 is simply unparalleled and has taken enormous proportions.
<br><br>
But the moment something becomes a serious addiction; the urge to excel, the desire to be the best increases; and to be the best, perfection is needed. And that’s where the name of the Kgp Cyber League comes up.
<br><br>
In the winters of 2005, a few motivated Counter Strike (CS) players of Kgp decided that they need to have a community, a place where all the CS players can come and share their experience and problems and of course the remedial fundas (for the uninitiated, funda in Kgp refers to those five-minute long “see-i-am-an-experienced-pro-and-i-can-help-you-noobs” lectures, a senior is ever ready to give to his juniors!). And that was when the Kgp Cyber League (KCL) was set up.
The KCL was born with a motive of employing fair competition, exposure and a sense of tactical knowledge coupled with skills and class in counter-strike players and to encourage the culture of positive and competitive gaming in young Kgpians.
<br><br>
KCL is the brain-child of men like Rahul Chauhan (ice), Tusharkanti Behera (tkb), Pandey Anshuman Kishore (ans) and Dipanjan Biswas (Dip) ; men who decided to make a difference to the Kgp Gaming. The amount of work that these men have done in creating a society of Kgp gamers is perhaps the best example of dedication and passion.
<br><br>
Thanks to the local servers run by the KCL, the players have become trained enough to start going out and challenging the world.The With the onset of KCL 2.0 Spring Championships (20th-22nd March 09'), this new installer was launched to upgrade the Counter Strike protocol used in KGP from 47 to 48, to be in sync with rest of the world. For the first time ever, Counter Strike 1.6, Age of Empire, FIFA 09 and NFS Most Wanted (only for female gamers) came alive in this version of KCL Cyber Championships.
<br><br>
But this is just a beginning. A lot more has to be achieved to make IIT Kgp, a Mecca for cyber gamers and for this the KCL has got to run a long, tough but thoroughly rewarding race.
<br><br>
Though, one thing is for sure, A new day has begun; The KCL motto of “Revolutionizing Gaming” is finally coming true!
<br><br>
CHEERS TO THE NEVER-SAY-DIE SPIRIT OF IIT Kgp and the KCL!
